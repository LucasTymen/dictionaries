Creating Dictionaries
Introduction to Python Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs.

It provides us with a way to map pieces of data to each other so that we can quickly find values that are associated with
one another.

Suppose we want to store the prices of various items sold at a cafe:

    Avocado Toast is 6 dollars
    Carrot Juice is 5 dollars
    Blueberry Muffin is 2 dollars

In Python, we can create a dictionary called menu to store this data:
"""
menu = {"avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
"""
Notice that:

    A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces { and }.
    Each item consists of a key ("avocado toast") and a value (6).
    Each key: value pair is separated by a comma.

It’s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but our code will still run without the space.
Instructions
1.

Suppose we have a dictionary of temperature sensors in the house and what temperatures they read. We’ve just added a
sensor to the "pantry", and it reads 22 degrees.

Add this pair to the dictionary on line 1.
2.

Remove the # in front of the definition of the dictionary num_cameras, which represents the number of cameras in each
area around the house.

If you run this code, you’ll get an error:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Try to find and fix the syntax error to make this code run.
