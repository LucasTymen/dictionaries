Creating Dictionaries
Add A Key

To add a single key: value pair to a dictionary, we can use the syntax:
"""
dictionary[key] = value
"""
For example, if we had our menu dictionary from the first exercise:
"""
menu = {"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
"""
And we wanted to add a new item, "cheesecake" for 8 dollars, we could use:
"""
menu["cheesecake"] = 8
"""
Now, menu looks like:

{"oatmeal": 3, "avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2, "cheesecake": 8}

Instructions
1.

Create an empty dictionary called animals_in_zoo.
2.

Walking around the zoo, you see 8 zebras. Add "zebras" to animals_in_zoo as a key with a value of 8.
3.

The primate house was bananas! Add "monkeys" to animals_in_zoo as a key with a value of 12.
4.

As you leave the zoo, you are saddened that you did not see any dinosaurs. Add "dinosaurs" to animals_in_zoo as a key
with a value of 0.
5.

Print animals_in_zoo.
