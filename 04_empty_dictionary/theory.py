Creating Dictionaries
Empty Dictionary

A dictionary doesn’t have to contain anything. Sometimes we need to create an empty dictionary when we plan to fill it
later based on some other input.

We can create an empty dictionary like this:
"""
empty_dict = {}
"""
We will explore ways to fill a dictionary in the next exercise.
Instructions
